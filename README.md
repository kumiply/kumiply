- 👋 Hi, I’m @kumiply

- 👀 I’m working towards developing and working with machine learning/blockchain software.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning different Python modules and object oriented programming (OOP). 
        I hope to deeper understand how to problem solve as a computer scientist.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with any python developers working on beginner to intermediate projects. 
        I am also going to be looking into front-end web-development so I'd love an insentive to learn that quickly.
